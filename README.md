## Demo

### Learning outcomes

This demo app will be used to learn the following:

 - Understanding of git and git workflow
 - Test Driven Development
 - Rails best practices

### Understanding git and git workflow

For a start, you could use [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

#### Agriteer git workflow

 - Branch out of the main branch into the new branch.
 - The new branch should be named after the new feature, fix or chore.
 - Use [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/) as you work.
 - Commit messages should have descriptive messages
 - When the job is done, push to the remote  branch named after same branch you are working on
 - Raise a Pull Request on the default branch (Usually master)
 - Ensure that the code is reviewed by team members
 - Necessary corrections should be made before merging

### Test Driven Development

To understand Test Driven Development, I recommend you use Michael Hartl's
[Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). This will be helpful in learning to use TDD.

### Rails Best Practices

I'd keep you posted as we continue with this.

Cheers!
